# UHealth

## Purpose

The purpose of the UHealth application is to allow users to search for medical facilities and pharmacies in the area of their choice. The user will either allow the application to utilize the device's location services, or enter a zipcode, before returning the medical facilities in that area. The user can then see pertinent details about those medical facilities, and also compare the details of multiple facilities against one another. 

The overall goal of the application is to help users find medical facilties in an area that they are unfamiliar with, or perhaps to shop facilities for the cheapest procedure cost in their local area.
